# Data Structures Homeworks (SabancÄ± University, CS300)
# Homework 1: N-Queens Problem using Stack

# Purpose
This homework implements the classic N-Queens puzzle using a stack-based approach instead of traditional recursion. The program finds all possible ways to place N queens on an NxN chessboard where no two queens threaten each other.


# Features
- Template-based Stack implementation for backtracking
- Efficient position checking using a safe matrix
- Solution output to text file
- Complete state management for queen positions
- Input validation for board size

# Homework 2: Point Quadtree Implementation
# Purpose
This homework implements a point quadtree for efficient storage and querying of 2D spatial data, specifically focusing on storing city locations and performing radius-based searches.

# Features
- Dynamic quadtree construction for 2D points
- Efficient spatial search operations
- Pretty print functionality for tree visualization
- Support for radius-based queries
- City data management with coordinates

# Query Operations

**Insert:** Add new cities with coordinates
**Search:** Find cities within specified radius
**Pretty Print:** Visualize the tree structure

# Homework 3: Image Detection with HashTable
# Purpose
This homework implements a basic image detection system using hash tables and Run Length Encoding (RLE) for processing and storing binary images.

# Features
- Run Length Encoding (RLE) for binary image compression
- Hash table implementation with collision handling
- 28x28 binary image processing
- Efficient image matching and retrieval
- Linear probing for collision resolution

# Image Processing

- Binary image to RLE conversion
- Hash-based storage and retrieval
- Collision handling with linear probing
- Exact image matching capability

# Homework 4: Bipartite Graph Matching
# Purpose
This homework implements maximum matching in bipartite graphs to solve worker-task assignment optimization problems.

# Features
- Bipartite graph validation
- Maximum matching algorithm implementation
- Augmenting path detection
- Worker-task assignment optimization
- Graph input processing from text files

# Algorithm Components

- Bipartite validation using graph coloring
- Maximum matching using augmenting paths
